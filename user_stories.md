As a user:

* I can define what roles are required to make this start-up successful
* The responsibilities of each role is evident
* Because this is a start-up,, different teams have different roles which will in the end come together to create the app.
* Therefore, building the app will be split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on. The roles will consist of these 3 roles:
  1) Marketing Research Team
  2) Developer
  3) Focus group participant

1) Marketing Research Team
2) Developer
3) Focus group participant


As a power user, I can:
* Create a new repo for the weekly project: bus_mall at the root level of my ~/CF/201 directory.
* Scaffold my repo with the usual README, CSS, JS, HTML and an img/ directory.
* Retrieve the assets from the assets/ directory in the week-03 directory of our class repo, and place them in my image directory. Manage             the size and type.
* Specify files such as the image folder, and choose a file extension that I can work with, and possibly convert them to be consistent for usibility.
* Ensure that there are 4-5 User Stories per role and place them in a file called user_stories.md in my repo.
* Utilize good Markdown style to make this document look nice.
* Build a __ where Three Random Photos will be selected from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
* Build in the ability to receive Clicks on the displayed images, and track the clicks for each image.
* I will also want to track the # of times an image is displayed for statistical purposes.
* Upon receiving a Click, three new non-duplicate random images will be automatically displayed.
* In order to ensure this I will write a Constructor Function that creates an object associated with each image, and has, at a minimum, properties for the name of the image (for display purposes), its filepath the $ of times it ha been shown, and the # of times it has been clicked.
* It will be useful to create a property that contains a text string that I can use as an ID in HTML.
